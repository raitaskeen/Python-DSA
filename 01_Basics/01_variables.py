# Variables in Python

# What is a Variable?
#A variable is like a box where you can store a value. You can give this box a name,
#and then you can use the name to get the value from the box whenever you need it.

# 
# How to create a variable?
# In Python, you can create a variable by giving it a name and assigning a value to it.
# The assignment operator in Python is the equal sign (=).
