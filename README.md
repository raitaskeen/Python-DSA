## Basics

The `basics` directory contains scripts that cover fundamental Python concepts. Each script focuses on a specific topic to help you build a strong foundation in Python programming.

- `01_variables.py`: Introduction to variables.
- `02_data_types.py`: Overview of different data types.
- `03_control_structures.py`: Control structures like if-else and loops.
- `04_functions.py`: Defining and using functions.
- `05_lists.py`: Working with lists.
- `06_dictionaries.py`: Working with dictionaries.
- `07_strings.py`: String manipulation.
- `08_file_io.py`: File input and output operations.

## Programs

The `programs` directory contains simple Python programs to practice basic concepts and improve your coding skills.

- `01_hello_world.py`: A simple hello world program.
- `02_calculator.py`: A basic calculator.
- `03_todo_list.py`: A simple to-do list application.
- `04_guessing_game.py`: A number guessing game.

## Data Structures

The `data_structures` directory contains implementations of various data structures. Each script demonstrates how to create and manipulate a specific data structure.

- `01_arrays.py`: Implementation of arrays.
- `02_linked_lists.py`: Implementation of linked lists.
- `03_stacks.py`: Implementation of stacks.
- `04_queues.py`: Implementation of queues.
- `05_trees.py`: Implementation of trees.
- `06_graphs.py`: Implementation of graphs.
- `07_hash_tables.py`: Implementation of hash tables.

## Algorithms

The `algorithms` directory contains implementations of various algorithms, organized into subfolders for sorting, searching, and recursion.

### Sorting

- `bubble_sort.py`: Implementation of bubble sort.
- `selection_sort.py`: Implementation of selection sort.
- `insertion_sort.py`: Implementation of insertion sort.
- `merge_sort.py`: Implementation of merge sort.
- `quick_sort.py`: Implementation of quick sort.

### Searching

- `linear_search.py`: Implementation of linear search.
- `binary_search.py`: Implementation of binary search.

### Recursion

- `factorial.py`: Recursive implementation of factorial.
- `fibonacci.py`: Recursive implementation of Fibonacci sequence.
- `tower_of_hanoi.py`: Recursive solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem.

## Extra Materials

The `extra_materials` directory contains additional materials for in-depth learning, including object-oriented programming (OOP), modules and packages, exception handling, and file handling.

### OOP

- `classes_and_objects.py`: Introduction to classes and objects.
- `inheritance.py`: Understanding inheritance.
- `polymorphism.py`: Understanding polymorphism.
- `encapsulation.py`: Understanding encapsulation.

### Modules and Packages

- `creating_modules.py`: How to create modules.
- `using_packages.py`: How to use packages.

### Exceptions

- `handling_exceptions.py`: Handling exceptions in Python.
- `custom_exceptions.py`: Creating custom exceptions.

### File Handling

- `reading_files.py`: Reading from files.
- `writing_files.py`: Writing to files.
